# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis: Association Rule Mining with Python & Power BI

This project explores consumer purchasing patterns using **Market Basket Analysis** with the **Apriori algorithm**. The goal is to uncover frequent itemsets and generate association rules from transactional data, helping businesses understand which products are often bought together.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Identify combinations of products that are frequently purchased together
- Use association rules to derive actionable insights (e.g., "If X is bought, recommend Y")
- Visualize KPIs such as **Support**, **Confidence**, and **Lift** in an interactive Power BI dashboard

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data wrangling & Apriori analysis (`mlxtend`, `pandas`)
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard for non-technical stakeholders
- **Google Drive**: Hosting large files not supported by GitHub
